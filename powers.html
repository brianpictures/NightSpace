	<h1>Got any abilities?</h1>
	<p>You can say that I do. Not naturaly, like I wasn't born with them, but I got them with this suit that I made; this one that I'm wearing right now. I can lift things that i couldn't have before; Enhanced srength. I move quuicker, not like the speed of light but I am fast; reflexes got faster too. It bugs out on me every once in a while becuase its all out of spare parts but it does the job, i dont have money like the rest to buy those suits that have everything ready.</p>
