	<h1>Whats your backstory? The life story.</h1>
	<p>I guess you can say that I'm hispanic based on where my parents come from, but i was born here thanks to my parents; sacrificing to get here. I live outside of the city, about a half hour away on the bullet. Nice and calm over there, yet still noisey at times; some crime here and there like in every place.</p>
